// Drivers are concerned with the mileage their automobiles get. One driver has
// kept track of several trips by recording the miles driven and gallons used for
// each tankful.
//
// Develop a Java application that will input the miles driven and gallons used
// (both as integers) for each trip.
//
// The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each
// trip and print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all trips up to this point.
// 
// All averaging calculations should produce floating-point results. Use class Scanner
// and sentinel-controlled repetition to obtain the data from the user.
